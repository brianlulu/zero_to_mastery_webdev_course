Bootstrap

- CDN (Content Distributed Network): User can just use this network to import the CSS file from the server/network.

- When importing JS file, the best practice is to imported in the end of the body tag. This is because that you want the other html tag and css file to be loaded first before the js file. In this way, the user will see the webpage first, then the js script will be loaded. If not, the js file will be loaded first, then the page will to load after.

- For updating Bootstrap version for your project, simply just replace the link tag for your css import and script tag for your js import on your html file.

- Bootstrap Grid is used to build a responsive website according to the user screen size. 
    - Each row in bootstrap grid system has total 12 columns.
    - We can custom the layout of your html element base on the screen size.
        - Ex. col-sm-6 -> This means that the html element occupy 6 columns out of 12 columns on a small screen
    - If the total number of columns of all the elements inside the same row exceeds the 12 columns, the last extra element will automatically be in the next row. 
        - Ex. 
            <div class="col col-sm-6"> 1 <div>
            <div class="col col-sm-6"> 2 <div>
            <div class="col col-sm-3"> 3 <div>
            This 3 div element will be on second row
